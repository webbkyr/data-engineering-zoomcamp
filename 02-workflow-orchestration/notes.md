# Workflow Orchestration
Orchestrator (i.e. Kestra, Airflow) ensures independent pieces of our pipeline can work together: code, database, Cloud provider. Supercharges existing data pipelines.
* Provides logging information between the tools
* Can have logic to run things in parallel
* Workflows can be run on a schedule or be event-based

## Building Orchestration Workflow with Kestra
* Kestra is an orchestration platform to manage business-critical workflows. They can be built with code, no code, AI copilot
* Language-agnostic (vs. Airflow, which is Python based)
