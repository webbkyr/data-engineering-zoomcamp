# Module 5 Homework Responses

## Question 1. Bruin Pipeline Structure
In a Bruin project, what are the required files/directories?
* .bruin.yml and pipeline/ with pipeline.yml and assets/

## Question 2. Materialization Strategies
You're building a pipeline that processes NYC taxi data organized by month based on pickup_datetime. Which incremental strategy is best for processing a specific interval period by deleting and inserting data for that time period?
* time_interval - incremental based on a time column

## Question 3. Pipeline Variables
You have the following variable defined in pipeline.yml:

```yaml
variables:
  taxi_types:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
    default: ["yellow", "green"]
```
How do you override this when running the pipeline to only process yellow taxis?
* bruin run --var 'taxi_types=["yellow"]'

## Question 4. Running with Dependencies
You've modified the ingestion/trips.py asset and want to run it plus all downstream assets. Which command should you use?
* bruin run ingestion/trips.py --downstream

## Question 5. Quality Checks
You want to ensure the pickup_datetime column in your trips table never has NULL values. Which quality check should you add to your asset definition?
* name: not_null

## Question 6. Lineage and Dependencies
After building your pipeline, you want to visualize the dependency graph between assets. Which Bruin command should you use?
* bruin lineage

## Question 7. First-Time Run
You're running a Bruin pipeline for the first time on a new DuckDB database. What flag should you use to ensure tables are created from scratch?
* --full-refresh
